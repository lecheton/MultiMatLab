In this project, I created a function to model the QRS wave of a heartbeat. For my freestyle project, I wanted to try to delve into a topic that I find fascinating: medicine. I found that heartbeats are based off of imported data, but can also be synthesized using a few functions. So, I created a function where one can model the QRS wave put inputting their heart rate, frequency, pulse width, amplitude of the heartbeat in microvolts, as well as the desired duration of the graph. First, I created an array for time, based off of the given frequency, which begins at time zero and ends at the desired duration. Then, I divided 60 by the given heart rate and called it delay. I created an array based off of the time started and desired duration and split it into intervals based on the delay given by the heartrate. Afterwards, I used a pulse train function on MatLab, which takes the desired function and plays a pulse train for the time inputted and repeats the function for after every inputted delay. The pulse train also takes the function and plays it for the length of the desired pulse width. I multiplied the pulse by the amplitude and finally, plotted a graph of amplitude versus time.
 In this project, I acquired the ability to do several new tasks. I became more familiar with the pulse train function and how to repeat a desired function for a given length. I also became more familiar with created arrays based off of given information.
