In this project, I created a script which compared the rank of a tennis player with their serve index. The serve index is made up of the percentages of 1st serves in, 1st serve points won, 2nd serve points won, and service games won as well as takes into accounts average aces and double faults per match. I have collected statistics from the top fifty best servers currently in the ATP and compiled the data in an Excel document. First, I imported the data into MATLAB from Excel and separated each set of statistic into its own table. Then, I converted the tables to arrays and from there, added and subtracted the arrays in a certain arrangement to find the serving index for each player, used by most rankings. I then plotted a bar graph to compare the rank of a player with their serving index and labelled the axis as needed.  From there, I used a correlation value program built into MATLAB to analyze the relation of the data. Finally, I displayed the correlation factors using texts, as well as converting numbers to strings and concatenation. In addition, I included a description of correlation value, to show others unfamiliar to this statistic about what the values mean.

In this project, I acquired information on how to import data, convert table to arrays, find correlation factors, and apply data in a bar graph. In the bar graph, I learned how to set the limits of the axis and add texts in a desired location, through converting number to strings and the concatenation of texts and strings.
