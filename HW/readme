 	For the homework problems, I tackled four different problems that we had discussed in class: finding the speed and acceleration of a vector function, finding directional derivatives, and the multi-variable chain rule. To find the speed and acceleration of a vector function, I made a function, where one would input the x, y, and z components/ functions of a vector in terms of t. I took the first derivative of each of the components using the differentiation function and squared each derivative and took the square root of the sums to find the speed. I then took the second derivative of each component and again took the square root of the square of the sums to find the acceleration function. For my third homework project, I made a function where one inputs a function, point, and vector. I took the partial derivatives with respect to x and then with respect to y and created a vector to show the directional gradient. I substituted x and y with the desired points. Then I took the input vector and divided it by its magnitude to find the unit vector. Lastly I took the dot product of the unit vector and the gradient to find the directional derivative. For my last problem, I created a function for the multivariable chain rule with a given function and its x and y components. I took the partial derivatives with respect to x and with respect to y. I multiplied each function with its counterpart derivative with respect to t to find the multivariable derivative. With these problems, I learned how to take partial derivatives and how to substitute variables with values.
