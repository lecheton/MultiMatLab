In this project, I applied multivariable calculus to the studies of cell potential, specifically neuron potential. However, its uses can vary. For this project, I used the Nernst equation, commonly used in chemistry, which is based off of multivariable calculus and derived using partial derivatives and integrals from the Nernst-Planck equation. The Nernst equation is used to measure the electron potential (Voltage) between two regions, with this scenario being the inside and outside of a cell. The voltage is dependent on a few factors, so I designed a function to input these factors and find the voltage due to an ion, as well as plot a graph showing its relationship with temperature. The inputs require temperature (in degrees Celsius), valence electrons involved (charge), as well as the concentration of the ions in and outside of the cell. I used the input values and plugged them into the Nernst equation. The output gives the input temperature in Kelvin as well as the voltage due to the ion. In addition, I created a graph to show the effect of temperature on voltage. I made an array and named it Kelvin, which represented a range of temperatures from 273K to 313K using the linspace function. Then, I created the voltage function based off of the Kelvin array. Lastly, I plotted a Voltage vs. Kelvin graph to show the viewer how temperature affects voltage. 
For this project, I acquired new skills, specifically on how to use the linspace function and create an array of values to use for a graph. For this project, I also learned how to edit the material on graphs.
